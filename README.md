# Blue Rabbit Code Challenge

Fork this repo and create a Full Stack app using languages and frameworks of your choice that, 
literally, introduces you to us. Submit your response back to us here in the form of a pull 
request or submit it to us privately. Please don't spend more than a couple hours on it.

### Requirements
* A backend with an API that accepts your name and stores it. The shape of the data 
and the storage mechanism are up to you. 
* An API endpoint or operation that we can call to get your information. The shape of the API 
is not important. It's even ok if it takes no params and returns only your name. Just let us know
how to call it. 
* A minimal frontend that collects your name and sends it to the API above for storage.
* A README with instructions on how to build/run the app and call your API. Please include notes
on why you chose the technologies you did. Any notes on design patterns, challenges, or aspects
of your stack that you find interesting are also appreciated! 

### Bonus Feature
* Collect and store an avatar that represents you (no real images of yourself please) using the
same frontend and backend that collects and stores your name.
